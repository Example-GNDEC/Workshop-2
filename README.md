# Summary and Setup

The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because it’s a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.

## Prerequisites

This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the shell. If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing), you’re ready for this lesson.

If you’re already comfortable manipulating files and directories, searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](#).

## Download Files

You need to download some files to follow this lesson.

1. Download `shell-lesson-data.zip` and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file. Let your instructor know if you need help with this step. You should end up with a new folder called `shell-lesson-data` on your Desktop.

## Install Software

If you do not already have the shell software installed, you will need to download and install it.

## Open a New Shell

After installing the software:

1. Open a terminal. If you’re not sure how to open a terminal on your operating system, see the instructions below.
2. In the terminal type `cd` then press the `Return` key. This step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.
3. In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data files in this folder.

## Where to Type Commands: How to Open a New Shell

The shell is a program that enables us to send commands to the computer and receive output. It is also referred to as the terminal or command line.

Some computers include a default Unix Shell program. The steps below describe some methods for identifying and opening a Unix Shell program if you already have one installed. There are also options for identifying and downloading a Unix Shell program, a Linux/UNIX emulator, or a program to access a Unix Shell on a server.

If none of the options below address your circumstances, try an online search for: `Unix shell [your computer model] [your operating system]`.
